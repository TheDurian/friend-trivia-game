# Friend Trivia Game

This is a trivia game to play with friends.

## How to Play

To start, each player must include their name in the config.

When the program is run, a file will be generated for each player.
Each player should be provided their own file and should keep the contents
secret.

Players will take turns presenting a set of prompts (for example, 4 at a time). To 
present, a player will answer the prompt and pull up an image that represents the
answer that they chose. The player shows this image to the rest of the players and
has the rest of the players either provide a rating or answer the question. This
can be done on a countdown.

Once every player has answered the prompt, the player can reveal what the prompt
was. They will receive a point if the answer the player thought of matches the responses
to the prompt.

## Example

Assuming a game with 3 players and 1 prompt for each player:

Player 1 has the prompt: "A music artist / band that everybody would rate a 8-10"
Player 1 decides to answer with "All Time Low". They ask the rest of the players what they would rate the band.
Assuming every player rated the band with an 8/9/10, Player 1 will receive a point. Otherwise, they would continue to the 
next question.
